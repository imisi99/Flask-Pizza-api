# Flask-Pizza-api
This is a store api that is built with flask and postgresql
It uses jwt for user authentication and authorization
It lets users:
- Create Items, Stores and Tags
- Have total access to do things like edit and delete items,stores and tags that have already been created
- It incorporates a strong database relationship that ensures  data integrity.
- It has protected routes that requires jwt_token to be able to access
To run the application you can use docker or python virtual environment (pip install -r requirements.txt)
The swaager-ui view of the api is [here](https://)
